The High Cloud Airline project aimed to uncover operational inefficiencies and customer behavior patterns to help the organization make data-driven decisions.

During the analysis, several key insights were identified:

Uneven load factor trends were discovered across different months and days, highlighting potential underutilization of flights during specific periods. This insight helped the organization optimize flight schedules and improve seat occupancy rates.

A significant volume of short-distance flights was identified, prompting a review of cost-efficiency for those routes.

Patterns in popular city-to-city routes allowed the company to identify high-demand travel corridors, which supported decisions on increasing flight frequency or improving services on those routes.

Analysis of customer preferences revealed top-performing carriers, helping the organization evaluate partnerships and improve customer satisfaction.

Insights into seasonal performance dips and regional demand fluctuations enabled the airline to adjust marketing and pricing strategies accordingly.

Overall, the project provided a deeper understanding of operational trends, customer behavior, and route performance. These insights empowered the organization to enhance route planning, improve load management, and boost overall profitability
